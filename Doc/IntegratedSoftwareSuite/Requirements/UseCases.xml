  <title>Use cases</title>
  <para>In this chapter, we formalize the main features to be captured by the
  integrated software suite into use cases.</para>

    <title>Systems biology model building cycle implementation</title>
    <formalpara>
      <title>Model building steps</title>
      <para>The chosen architecture should consist in an implementation of the
      systems biology model building cycle. It should allow modelers to execute
      all the steps of this cycle on a given model with a given data set.
      </para>

    <formalpara>
      <title>Integration of <literal>BioPreDyn</literal> tools</title>
      <para>As a part of the <literal>BioPreDyn</literal> project, the resulting
      software suite should use as many software tools developed within the
      consortium as possible, and integrate them as building blocks for the
      steps they cover.</para>
    </formalpara>
    <formalpara>
      <title>Graphical user interface</title>
      <para>As a tool intended to non-developers, the
      <literal>BioPreDyn</literal> software suite should be as user-friendly as
      possible, and give access to all its functionalities through a convenient
      graphical user interface.</para>

    <title>Modularity</title>

      <title>Sparse model building cycle</title>
      <para>
      Not all the biochemical models use all the steps described in the
      <link linkend="SBModelBuildingCycle">systems biology model building
      cycle</link>; most of them use only a subset of those steps. As a
      consequence, the chosen design should allow any combination of operation
      on the input model file.

      <title>Third party components</title>
      <para>
      The <literal>BioPreDyn</literal> integrated software suite should not be
      limited to consortium tools only, and should allow third-party tool
      integration as model building blocks.

  <section id="UseCaseSimulationFileStandard">
    <title>Simulation file standard</title>
    <formalpara>
      <title>Standard formats</title>
      <para>In order to be easily interfaced with other tools, the integrated
      software suite should be compatible with reference biochemical model and
      data formats.</para>
    </formalpara>
    <formalpara>
      <title>Simulation formats</title>
      <para>Model and data are closely related in the described model building
      cycle; each output model file should therefore be associated with the data
      used for model calibration. Similarly, the conditions according to which
      the model should be simulated should be specified in the model file, along
      with the results of this simulation. Such model / data structures are
      described both in <link linkend="ReferencesSEDML">SED-ML</link> and
      <link linkend="ReferencesSBRML">SBRML</link> languages.</para>

    <title>Validation cases</title>
    <formalpara>
      <title>Systems biology model building cycle prototype</title>
      <para>A simple example of systems biology model (such as the one described
      in <link linkend="ReferencesSBCycle">[3]</link>) should be implemented as
      a proof of concept of the <literal>BioPreDyn</literal>software suite.
