The following Python scripts aim at implementing most steps of the
[systems biology model building cycle](https://github.com/bmoreau/biopredyn/wiki/sb_model_building_cycle)
as defined by the [BioPreDyn project](http://www.biopredyn.eu/) members. They
require the BioPreDyn [software suite](https://github.com/bmoreau/biopredyn)
to be installed.

Methods implemented in those scripts are described in:

Ashyraliyev, M., Fomekong-Nanfack, Y., Kaandorp, J. a, & Blom, J. G. (2009).

doi:10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06844.x

To run a script, simply type:

```python
python <script.py>
```

### `solver_comparison.py`

Runs a time course simulation between t = 0 and 20 on a simple model of
enzymatic reaction with two different solvers (one stiff and the other
non-stiff) and compare them graphically.

The model (`FEBS_antimony.xml`) was written in SBML using
[QtAntimony](http://antimony.sourceforge.net/antimony-qt.html). The script uses
[libSBMLSim](http://fun.bio.keio.ac.jp/software/libsbmlsim/) as a simulation
engine.

### `data_generation.py`

Generates artificial data based on the simulation described in the
`generate_data.xml` SED-ML file and split it into calibration and validation
data. Adds heteroscedastic noise to it. The script uses
[COPASI](http://www.copasi.org) as a simulation engine.

### `parameter_estimation.py`

Estimates the values of k1, k2 and k3 parameters in `FEBS_antimony.xml` model
using the calibration data generated by `data_generation.py`. Computes and
displays various indicators and statistics for this estimation. It uses
[COPASI](http://www.copasi.org) as a simulation engine.

### `model_discrimination.py`

Runs a parameter estimation 3 times on the same model using a stochastic
optimization algrithm, then compare the models by computing their respective
AIC and BIC. It uses [COPASI](http://www.copasi.org) as a simulation engine.
