The following Python scripts aim at implementing most steps of the
[systems biology model building cycle](https://github.com/bmoreau/biopredyn/wiki/sb_model_building_cycle)
as defined by the [BioPreDyn project](http://www.biopredyn.eu/) members. They
require the BioPreDyn [software suite](https://github.com/bmoreau/biopredyn)
to be installed.

To run a script, simply type:

  python <script.py>
